# KSUWEBPMOCAP
My first full life cycle development project. Built for Kennesaw State University.

This was my teams final project. We were asked by the school to build a database, front and back end, for the management of future capstone projects. 

We began with Q@A, brainstorming, and the first version of a Schema for the database. We were able to achieve all the required deliverables set down in the orginal Q&A meeting, as well as extra content requested during project development.
