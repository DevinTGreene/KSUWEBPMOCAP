# KSUWEBPMOCAP
My first full life cycle development project. Built for Kennesaw State University.

This was my teams final project. We were asked by the school to build a database, front and back end, for the management of future capstone projects. 

We began with Q@A, brainstorming, and the first version of a Schema for the database. We were able to achieve all the required deliverables set down in the orginal Q&A meeting, as well as extra content requested during project development. 

It should be noted that these projects files have no connection to any current KSU systems. We developed entirely off site from KSU systems and handed off these files to the school, so that new project groups could begin integration.
